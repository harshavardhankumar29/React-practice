Got it — here is a **short, simple, improved** version:

---

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to run React with Vite, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and basic ESLint rules.

---

## React Plugins

Two official plugins are available:

* **@vitejs/plugin-react** — uses Babel + Fast Refresh
* **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc** — uses SWC (faster) + Fast Refresh

---

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is **not enabled** by default.
To add it, follow the official guide:
[https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation)

---

## ESLint Configuration

If you're building a production-ready app, consider:

* Using **TypeScript**
* Enabling **type-aware ESLint rules**

You can refer to the TS template for an example:
[https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts)

---

If you want, I can make it even shorter.
